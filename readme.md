# RoR with Repository Pattern

Sample code demonstrating use of repository pattern in Ruby on Rails (RoR).

## The Dev Container

When using VS Code the dev container is automatically built, started and connect to. It's currently based on `ruby:2.6.2`. Note that the base image is debian based linux docker image.

When the dev container is built, it also installs the following:

    * sqlite3
    * yarn and dependencies
    * Rails 6.0.0
    * VS Code estensions for RoR development
